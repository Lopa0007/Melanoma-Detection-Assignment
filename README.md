## General Information
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early which accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. This study aims to build a solution that can evaluate images of different skin diseases and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma reducing a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. The images used for developing the solution were formed by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)



## Conclusions

A CNN model has been built after several trial and error based no combinations of feature maps, drop outs,augmented strategies, no of augmented samples. The model is able to achieve 70% accuracy on validation dataset. However, this still has overfiting issue (by 7%) which looks like a side-effect of augmented images. The results can be improved by training the model on more non-augmented training data.
